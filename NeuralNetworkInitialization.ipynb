    "To initialize a neural network is to set the weights and biases.  These parameters can be set to any random value and the neural network should learn just fine.  In order to get the neural network to learn much faster and acheive better performance, there are some weight initialization techniques that can be followed.  Below is a list of techniques:\n",

    "1. Zero initialization\n",
