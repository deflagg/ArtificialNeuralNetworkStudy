# ArtificialNeuralNetworkStudy
This repository is to facilitate my study of Artificial Neural Networks.  This includes JupyterLab, GitHub integration, Python development, Python libraries for graphing, TensorFlow, and the math behind the neural networks.

Open the ANNLearn.ipynb file to view the Jupyter Notebook or Lab.
The notebook can be opened in Github, but the images won't be rendered

To install Jupyter the easiest way, download and install Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/download/.  Here you will be able to manage the download and associated libraries.
